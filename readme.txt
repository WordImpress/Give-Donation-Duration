A Give Add-on which allows you to set a number of days or a specific date and time for which your donation form will end and display a custom message.

== Description ==

Form Countdown is a [Give](https://givewp.com) Add-on allows you to set a number of days or a specific date and time for which your donation form will end and display a custom message.

Limiting your donation campaigns to a certain time-frame is useful for communicating a sense of urgency. When your donors know that their window to donate is limited to a certain timeframe, they are less likely to postpone giving to a later time.

**FEATURES**

* Limit the form by a number of days from publication, or to a specific date/time.
* When the form is closed, display a custom message to your donors thanking them for their generosity.
* Enable a Countdown clock to your form in various positions to further add that sense of urgency.

**BASIC USAGE**

All of the Form Countdown settings are per form, so you will not find anything in "Donations > Settings". Instead, go to "Donations > All Forms" and click on your form.

There you'll see our tabbed "Donation Form Options" interface. At the bottom is a new tab called "Form Countdown". There you'll have the following options:

* **Enable Duration** -- Enable or Disable your Duration features. All other fields will appear when you select "Enable".
* **Donation Deadline** -- Set the Duration to end at a set number of days after the form is published, or at a specific day and time.
* **Date** -- If you selected "Day & Time" above, you'll see this option. This is a datepicker to allow you to choose any date in the future.
* **Time** -- If you selected "Day & Time" above, you'll see this option. Choose what time of day the form should close from a dropdown list.
* **Duration ended message** -- a WYSIWYG field to add any content you want to display to your donors when the duration is over. This will completely replace the

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.3 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0.15 or greater

= Automatic installation =

**NOTE:** Before installing Give Form Countdown, you must have the free [Give Donation plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/) installed and activated on your website.

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To install Give Form Countdown, login to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Give Form Countdown" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, ratings and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site before doing any plugin or theme updates just in case. If you have any trouble with an update, try out our [WP-Rollback plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rollback) which lets you revert to previous versions of WordPress plugins or themes with just a couple clicks.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This sounds great, but what is Give? =

[Give](https://givewp.com) is the most robust WordPress plugin available for accepting online donations. Give provides you with powerful features helping you raise more funds for your cause from one, effective, platform.

= My form also has a Goal. How do these work together? =

They work great together. If you've chosen a Goal for your form and NOT chosen to close it when the Goal is achieved, and the duration is not yet ended, you will continue to be able to receive donations and they will be reflected in the Progress Bar. Once the Duration end is reached, you'll be able to see the custom message you chose.

If you choose to close the form when your Goal is reached, you can choose either to show a simple message in your "Donation Goal" settings, or opt to show the "Duration achieved message" instead.

= How can I test the completion message? =

The easiest way is to manually change the date of your duration to be in the past. The datepicker won't let you choose a date in the past, but you can manually change it in the text field after the datepicker populates it.
